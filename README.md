# 🌀 Decimal to Binary Converter (Recursive)

A simple web-based application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that converts decimal numbers into binary using **Recursion**.

## 💡 Features
- Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Demonstrates recursion and base case logic
- Converts decimal to binary using stack call mechanism
- Interactive and beginner-friendly interface

## 📘 Overview
This project helps you understand recursion by solving a classic problem — converting decimal numbers into binary using pure JavaScript.

In this application, you'll learn how to:
- Build a simple user interface using HTML and CSS
- Implement recursion in JavaScript with a base and recursive case
- Use `Math.floor()` and `%` for binary calculation
- Display binary output dynamically

### 🔄 Example
```js
decimalToBinary(118); // Output: "1110110"
```
